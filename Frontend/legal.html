        <section class="space-y-6">
            <p>
                This Legal Notice and Disclaimer applies to your use of <strong>Algocdk</strong> (“the Platform”), owned
                and operated by <strong>CDK Technologies</strong>.
                By accessing or using Algocdk, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the
                following disclaimers and legal terms.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">1. No Financial or Investment Advice</h2>
            <p>
                Algocdk is a software platform designed to host and automate trading bots, strategies, and analytics.
                <strong>We do not provide financial, investment, or trading advice.</strong> All trading decisions and
                activities performed using Algocdk or its bots are at the sole risk of the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users should consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment or trading
                decision.
                Algocdk’s information, analysis tools, or AI-driven recommendations are provided for **educational and
                experimental purposes only**.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Trading Risk Warning</h2>
            <p>
                Trading in financial markets — including options, synthetic indices, forex, and derivatives — involves
                substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors.
                You should never trade with money you cannot afford to lose.
            </p>
            <p>
                The performance of any bot, strategy, or algorithm on Algocdk does not guarantee future results. Market
                conditions can change rapidly, and past performance is not a reliable indicator of future profitability.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Platform Liability</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Algocdk and CDK Technologies are not responsible for any direct, indirect, or consequential
                    financial losses resulting from use of the platform or bots.</li>
                <li>We make no guarantees about uptime, connectivity, or uninterrupted trading performance.</li>
                <li>Users are responsible for verifying the accuracy and performance of bots before enabling live
                    trading.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
            <p>
                Algocdk integrates with third-party services such as <strong>Deriv</strong> for trade execution and
                <strong>Paystack</strong> for payments.
                We do not control, endorse, or guarantee these third-party systems. Their reliability, policies, and
                service quality are outside Algocdk’s control.
                By connecting to these services, you agree to abide by their independent terms of service and privacy
                policies.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                All content, branding, and technology within Algocdk — including software, text, graphics, and
                trademarks — are the property of <strong>CDK Technologies</strong> or their respective owners.
                Unauthorized copying, redistribution, or modification of Algocdk’s intellectual property is prohibited.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">6. No Guarantee of Performance</h2>
            <p>
                Algocdk does not guarantee the profitability or accuracy of any algorithm, bot, or strategy provided on
                the platform.
                All simulations, analytics, and AI-based predictions are **estimates** and should not be interpreted as
                financial advice or promises of return.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, Algocdk, its developers, partners, and affiliates shall not be
                liable for any loss of profits, data, or damages
                arising from the use or inability to use the platform — even if advised of the possibility of such
                damages.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">8. Regulatory Compliance</h2>
            <p>
                Algocdk operates as a software provider, not as a broker, dealer, or financial institution.
                Users are solely responsible for complying with the trading regulations and laws in their respective
                countries.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">9. Changes to This Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
                Algocdk reserves the right to modify this Legal Notice and Disclaimer at any time. Updates will be
                reflected on this page, and the “Effective Date” will be updated accordingly.
                Continued use of the platform indicates acceptance of the latest version.
            </p>
